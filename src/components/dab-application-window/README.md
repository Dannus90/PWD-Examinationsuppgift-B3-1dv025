  // Creating a new instance of a specific application based on the detail name.
  const application = document.createElement(applicationName)
  const applicationWindow = document.createElement('dab-application-window')
  applicationWindow.setAttribute('slot', 'application')

  application.setAttribute('slot', 'application-container')

  applicationWindow.appendChild(application)

  applicationWindow.style.position = 'absolute'
  applicationWindow.style.top = `${windowPositionTop}%`
  applicationWindow.style.left = `${windowPositionLeft}%`
  applicationWindow.style.transform = `translate(${translationPositionX}%, ${translationPositionY}%)`

  windowPositionTop -= 1
  windowPositionLeft -= 1

  applicationArray.push(applicationWindow)

  pwdApplication.appendChild(applicationWindow)

  applicationWindow.addEventListener(('mousedown'), () => {
    applicationWindow.style.zIndex = 1000

    // Setting the z-index to 1 on all other applications that are not the current one.
    applicationArray.filter((app) => app !== applicationWindow).forEach((app) => {
      app.style.zIndex = 1
    })
  })
